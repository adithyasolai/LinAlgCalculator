# LinAlgEngine
Contains the `Matrix` and `Vector` object classes. 

The current functions of my Linear Algebra Engine include:
-3 major row operations (Row Substitution, Row Scale, and Row Swap) 
-Convert a Matrix to Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) 
-Find the determinant of a Matrix 
-Determine if a Matrix is triangular 
-Determine if a Matrix is invertible 
-Find the inverse of a Matrix

The implementation of these functions can be found in the `Matrix` class.
